Version 0.4.0
==============================================================================
Works with SharpArch 1.9

Version 0.3.0
==============================================================================
Removed PostSharp support.  If you were using PostSharp, you can use
the equivalent support found in SharpArchContrib.Castle instead.

Works with the Q3 release of SharpArch. 

Version 0.2.0
===============================================================================
Castle Interceptor versions of Log, Transaction and UnitOfWork attributes added.

I am looking for suggestions on how to make the Castle versions of these 
attributes work better.  Please post comments to the SharpArch list.
